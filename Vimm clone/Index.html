Modern tools can decrypt every disk and generate the correct ird, guaranteeing every ird in the PlayStation 3 Vault is accurate.</td>

The txt file will also be updated if the title or cue file changes. Speaking of cue files, a longstanding issue has been fixed where CDs with multiple copies of a file were all given the same name. Each copy now correctly matches the name in the cue file.</td>
